**Description**
Welcome to the Two-Player Dice Game GitHub repository! This is a web-based two-player dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is for two players to take turns rolling a single dice. They can roll the dice as many times as they wish on their turn, adding all the results to a running total. However, there's a catch: if a player rolls a 1, they lose all the points gained in their current turn. The game continues until one of the players reaches or exceeds a certain score, typically 100 points.

**Demo**
You can play the game by visiting the live demo here.

**Features**

1. Two players can take turns to play the game.
2. Roll a virtual dice to accumulate points on your turn.
3. Rolling a 1 ends the current player's turn, and they lose their turn's points.
4. Players can choose to "Hold" to add their current turn's points to their total score.
5. The game ends when one player reaches or exceeds a specified winning score.

**How to Play**

1. Open the game by visiting the live demo.
2. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. The number rolled will be added to your current turn's score.
3. You can continue rolling as many times as you want, but be cautious not to roll a 1, or you'll lose your turn's points.
4. To end your turn and add your current turn's score to your total, click the "Hold" button.
5. The game continues with the next player.
6. The first player to reach or exceed the winning score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
